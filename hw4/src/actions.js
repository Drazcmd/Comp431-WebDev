your application to your store. They are the only source of information for
the store. You send them to the store using store.dispatch().

Actions are plain JavaScript objects. Actions must have a type property that
indicates the type of action being performed.

Action creators are exactly that—functions that create actions. It's easy to
conflate the terms “action” and “action creator,” so do your best to use the
proper term.
In Redux action creators simply return an action:
