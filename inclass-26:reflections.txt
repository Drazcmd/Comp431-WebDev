1. Very little - this course was awesome

2. The game was really fun, and the way react-redux does state blew my mind

3. Both you and Suzanne were really really really good at explaining confusing
things and helping us out. Like, seriously helpful - I learned tons just from
asking you guys stuff.

4. The sudden jump into certain weirdness with arrow functions really confused
me, for example there was some weirdness with the particle constructor.

Also, despite spending hours on the multi-dispatch thing I could never figure
it out, even with your piazza posts - would have liked more in class
explanation. Getting set up with react-redux in general was pretty tough too

5. More undergraduate TAs. Suzanne was AMAZING, but far as I could tell the
grad students had no idea what was going on because they hadn't taken the
class before.

Also, grading needs to be worked on. There were two big issues.

First, since the different graders used different formats, I could tell that
my grade was higher or lower in some cases depending on just who I was being
graded by, and inconsistant from week to week. This shouldn't be happening,
the TAs need to communicate more about what they're expecitng of the students.

Second, I could tell that one of the harsher graders was applying the rubric
very mechanically without really thinking through things. There were some
times when I got large deductions meant for wide-spread coding style
violatings. Like once I think I got hit with the entire whole five poitn 'dead
code' penalty for what was two commented out console.log's (literally, I
checked and if I recall correclty these were the only two commented out lines
of code in my ENTIRE APP).
